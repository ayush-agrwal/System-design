"is a relation" and "has a relation" 
"Is a relation" (Inheritance): This implies an inheritance relationship. In object-oriented programming, it means that a class (the child) inherits from another class (the parent).

class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}


In this example, Dog "is a" type of Animal.


"Has a relation" (Composition): This implies a composition relationship, where a class contains references to other classes. This is often used to model "has a" relationships.

class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine starts.");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine; // Car "has a" Engine

    Car() {
        this.engine = new Engine();
    }

    void startCar() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car starts.");
    }
}
Car "has a" Engine.
