Step 1: The user initiates access to a protected resource through the client application.
Step 2: The client application redirects the user to the authorization server.
Step 3: The authorization server requests user authentication and permission.
Step 4: After granting permission, the authorization server redirects the user back to the client with an authorization code or token.
Step 5: The client application exchanges the authorization code for an access token by making a request to the authorization server.
Step 6: The authorization server issues an access token and sends it to the client.
Step 7: The client uses the access token to request the protected resource from the resource server.
Step 8: The resource server validates the token and returns the requested resource.
