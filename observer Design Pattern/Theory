The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern used to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the subject) changes its state, all dependent objects (the observers) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is particularly useful for implementing distributed event-handling systems.

Key Components:

##Subject: The object that maintains a list of observers and provides methods to add, remove, and notify them. It usually contains the core state that the observers are interested in.

##Observer: The interface or abstract class that defines the method(s) used to update the observers when the subject's state changes.

##ConcreteSubject: A subclass of the subject that implements the core state and the methods for adding, removing, and notifying observers.

##ConcreteObserver: A subclass of the observer that implements the update method to reflect changes in the subject's state.

the Observable class is part of the java.util package and is used to create objects that can be observed by other objects. It provides a way to implement the Observer Design Pattern without having to manually manage the list of observers and notify them.

Here are the key methods and functions of the Observable class:

addObserver(Observer o): Adds an observer to the list of observers. Observers are notified when the state of the Observable object changes.

deleteObserver(Observer o): Removes an observer from the list of observers. The observer will no longer receive notifications.

deleteObservers(): Removes all observers from the list. This can be useful for cleanup.

hasChanged(): Returns a boolean indicating whether the Observable object has been changed since the last notification.

clearChanged(): Clears the changed status of the Observable object.

setChanged(): Marks the Observable object as changed. This is necessary to notify observers.

notifyObservers(): Notifies all registered observers if the Observable object has been marked as changed.

notifyObservers(Object arg): Notifies all registered observers with an argument. This allows passing data to observers.
