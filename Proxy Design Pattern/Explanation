Subject Interface: Image declares a method display().

RealImage: Represents the actual image. It loads the image from disk when it is created and provides the display() method to show the image.

ProxyImage: Acts as a placeholder for the RealImage. It contains a reference to RealImage and delays loading the real image until the display() method is called.

Client: Uses ProxyImage to interact with the RealImage. The ProxyImage shows the placeholder until the real image needs to be displayed, thus managing resource usage efficiently.

This example demonstrates how the Proxy Design Pattern can manage resources effectively by delaying the creation and loading of the real object until it's actually needed.
