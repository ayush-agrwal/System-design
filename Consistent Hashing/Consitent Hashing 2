Client Application:

Function: Users interact with the system via a web interface or API.
Tasks: Submit URLs for shortening and retrieve original URLs.

Load Balancer:

Function: Distributes client requests to multiple instances of the URL Shortener Service.
Tasks: Ensures high availability and fault tolerance.

URL Shortener Service:

Function: Handles the logic for shortening URLs and retrieving the original URL.
Tasks:
Generate a hash of the original URL.
Encode the hash using Base64 and truncate it to the fixed length (e.g., 7 characters).
Check Zookeeper for conflicts and handle them if necessary.
Store the mapping in the database.
Provide an endpoint to retrieve the original URL from the shortened URL.

Zookeeper Cluster:

Function: Manages distributed coordination and synchronization.
Tasks:
Maintain a distributed counter for generating unique shortened URLs.
Provide configuration management and service discovery.
Ensure consistency and coordination across multiple instances of the URL Shortener Service.

Database (URL Mappings):

Function: Stores mappings between shortened URLs and original URLs.
Tasks:
Store and retrieve URL mappings.
Handle queries for URL lookups.
Analytics Service (Optional):

Function: Collects and analyzes traffic data for URLs.
Tasks:
Track the number of visits, geographic distribution, referrers, devices used, and browser information.
Generate reports and insights.


Workflow
Shortening a URL:

Step 1: Client sends a request with the original URL to the URL Shortener Service.
Step 2: URL Shortener Service generates a hash and encodes it.
Step 3: Service checks Zookeeper to ensure the hash is unique.
Step 4: If the hash is unique, the service stores the mapping in the database.
Step 5: Service returns the shortened URL to the client.
Retrieving an Original URL:

Step 1: Client sends a request with the shortened URL.
Step 2: URL Shortener Service queries the database to retrieve the original URL.
Step 3: Service returns the original URL to the client.
Handling Analytics (Optional):

Step 1: Analytics Service collects traffic data.
Step 2: Service processes and analyzes the data.
Step 3: Generates reports and insights.
Considerations
Scalability: Use horizontal scaling for the URL Shortener Service to handle large volumes of requests.
Consistency: Ensure consistency between Zookeeper and the database.
Fault Tolerance: Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms for Zookeeper and the database.
Security: Protect endpoints with authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Performance: Optimize database queries and use caching to enhance performance.
