Objective: To estimate the infrastructure requirements for a high-traffic distributed system, similar to a large-scale social media .
The focus is on understanding the server count, RAM, and storage needs, and making decisions based on the CAP theorem trade-offs.

1. Traffic Estimation
Assumptions:

Total users: 1 billion
Daily active users: 25% of total users = 250 million
Average queries per user per second: 7 (comprising read and write operations)
Estimation:

Total Queries per Second: 250 million users × 7 queries/user = 1.75 billion queries/day
Queries per Second: 1.75 billion queries/day ÷ (60 seconds × 60 minutes × 24 hours) = 20,241 queries/second
Explanation:
To handle high traffic, the system must support approximately 20,000 queries per second. This traffic estimation helps determine the required number of servers to maintain performance and responsiveness.

2. Storage Estimation
Assumptions:

Each user posts twice daily, with each post containing 250 characters
10% of users upload images, with each image averaging 300 KB
Estimation:

Post Storage:

Each post = 250 characters × 2 bytes/character = 500 bytes
For 250 million users, posting twice daily:
Daily Post Storage = 250 million users × 2 posts/user × 500 bytes/post = 250 GB/day
Annual Post Storage = 250 GB/day × 365 days = 91.25 TB/year
Image Storage:

10% of 250 million users = 25 million users uploading images
Daily Image Storage = 25 million users × 300 KB/image = 7,500 GB/day = 7.5 TB/day
Annual Image Storage = 7.5 TB/day × 365 days = 2,737.5 TB/year
Explanation:
The system needs substantial storage capacity to accommodate daily and annual data generated by user posts and image uploads. This estimation guides decisions on storage infrastructure to handle large volumes of data efficiently.

3. RAM Estimation
Assumptions:

Cache the last 5 posts for each user
Each post = 500 bytes
Estimation:

Memory Required per User: 5 posts × 500 bytes/post = 2,500 bytes = 2.5 KB
Total RAM for Active Users: 250 million users × 2.5 KB = 625 GB
Explanation:
The system requires approximately 625 GB of RAM to cache recent posts for all active users, ensuring quick access to frequently accessed data. This estimate is crucial for designing the caching layer to enhance performance.

4. Trade-offs (CAP Theorem)
Trade-off Decision:

Prioritized Properties: Availability and Partition Tolerance (AP)
Availability: Ensures the system remains operational and responsive to all requests, even if some nodes fail.
Partition Tolerance: The system can handle network partitions and continue to function across different segments of the network.
