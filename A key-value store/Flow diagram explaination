Primary Node

The request is routed to the primary node for the determined partition.
Replication

For PUT requests, the primary node stores the data and propagates the update to replica nodes.
Data Versioning

Updates are versioned to manage and resolve conflicts.
Gossip Protocol

Nodes exchange information about data updates and failures periodically.
Merkle Tree

Nodes use Merkle Trees to verify data consistency and reconcile discrepancies.
Client Response

For GET requests, data is retrieved from the primary or any replica node, ensuring eventual consistency.
