The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern used to add new functionalities to objects dynamically without altering their structure. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

What is the Decorator Pattern?
In the Decorator Pattern, you use "decorator" classes that wrap an existing object to add new behavior or responsibilities. The key idea is to extend the functionality of objects in a flexible and reusable way.

Key Components of the Decorator Pattern
Component: An interface or abstract class that defines the basic operations that can be performed.
ConcreteComponent: A class that implements the Component interface and defines the core functionality.
Decorator: An abstract class or interface that implements the Component interface and has a reference to a Component object.
ConcreteDecorator: Classes that extend the Decorator and add additional behavior or responsibilities.
Why Do We Need the Decorator Pattern?
Flexible Extension: The Decorator Pattern allows for adding new functionality to objects at runtime without altering their structure. This is more flexible than using inheritance, where changes require creating new subclasses.
Avoiding Large Hierarchies: Inheritance can lead to complex and rigid class hierarchies. The Decorator Pattern helps avoid this by composing behavior through decorators instead of creating a large number of subclasses.
Single Responsibility Principle: It helps in adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle by keeping each class focused on a specific aspect of behavior. Each decorator adds a specific feature or enhancement.
Reusability: Decorators can be reused across different objects, promoting code reusability. Different combinations of decorators can be applied to objects to achieve desired functionality.

Problem Solved by the Decorator Pattern
Dynamic Behavior Addition: It allows for adding behavior to objects dynamically at runtime, rather than at compile-time, which is often required when the exact set of features to add is not known ahead of time.
Avoiding Class Explosion: It prevents the need for creating numerous subclasses to combine different functionalities. Instead of creating many subclasses, you can combine multiple decorators.
Maintaining Open/Closed Principle: The pattern helps in keeping classes open for extension but closed for modification, which is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design.
